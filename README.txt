In the first question about Bayes Net Structure, we populated all of the necessary variables.
We then filled in the probabilities for the Y conditonal probabilty table. After that, we 
filled in the conditional probability table for observations based on the location of the houses.
We then implemented a way to calculate the conditional and unconditional variables for the joint
factors. We then removed the elimination variable from the factor. We then implemented a way to
normalize the factor by scaling the sum of all the probabilities to 1. We then used a variable
elimination inference algorithm to find the answer to the probabilitistic query which was later
used to figure out the most probable position for the food house. In the final question we found
the expected values for Pacman to rush left or rush right.
